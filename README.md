About

This project implements a RESTful API for a coffee specialist service. It provides endpoints to manage coffees, specialists, and user authentication. The README is intentionally generic — update the sections below to reflect the actual implementation details (framework, database, environment variables, and scripts) used in this repository.

Features
- CRUD for coffees
- CRUD for specialists
- Basic authentication (token/JWT-based)
- Configuration via environment variables
- Docker support

Tech stack (example)
- Node.js + Express (or your chosen framework)
- PostgreSQL (or another relational DB)
- JWT for authentication
- Docker & Docker Compose

Getting started

Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 16) and npm or yarn, or the appropriate runtime for your stack
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, recommended for local setup)
- A running database (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) or use the included Docker Compose setup

Installation
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/KIC8462852B/coffeespecialist-restapi.git
   cd coffeespecialist-restapi
2. Install dependencies
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root (example):

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/coffeespecialist
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_secure_random_secret

Adjust environment variables to match your environment. If you use Docker, set values in the docker-compose.yml or environment files accordingly.

Running locally
- Development mode (with live reload):
  npm run dev
- Production mode:
  npm start

API Overview

Authentication
- The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication in this example. Obtain a token via the auth endpoint (e.g., POST /auth/login) and pass it in the Authorization header:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>

Common endpoints (example path patterns — update to match your implementation):

- Auth
  - POST /auth/register  - register a new user
  - POST /auth/login     - obtain JWT

- Coffees
  - GET  /coffees        - list coffees (supports pagination and filtering)
  - GET  /coffees/:id    - get a single coffee
  - POST /coffees        - create a new coffee (auth required)
  - PUT  /coffees/:id    - update a coffee (auth required)
  - DELETE /coffees/:id - delete a coffee (auth required)

- Specialists
  - GET  /specialists         - list specialists
  - GET  /specialists/:id     - get a specialist
  - POST /specialists         - create a specialist (auth required)
  - PUT  /specialists/:id     - update a specialist (auth required)
  - DELETE /specialists/:id   - delete a specialist (auth required)

Replace the above endpoints with the actual routes used by the repository if they differ.

Testing
- Run unit and integration tests
  npm test

Docker
- Start the app with Docker Compose (example)
  docker-compose up --build
